# factory.config.json

Every key, what it does, and whether it is required. `src/config.mjs` validates the file and explains what is wrong. The template ships with placeholders (`OWNER`, `"ask"`) that the loader or the Box-creating scripts refuse, so nothing runs on values nobody chose.

## factory

| Key | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `repo` | yes | `owner/name` of the factory repo. The trigger workflows send their event here. |
| `boxNamePrefix` | yes | Every Box is named `<prefix><worker id>`. Pick one nothing else on the Upstash account uses. |
| `boxLabel` | yes | Label on every Box of this factory. At most 20 characters. The factory only ever lists Boxes with this label. |
| `busyLabel` | yes | Label a Box carries while it works on an issue. |
| `branchPrefix` | yes | Branches are `<prefix><issue number>`, for example `factory/issue-12`. |
| `gitAuthor.name`, `gitAuthor.email` | yes | Author of the factory's commits. The address of a real person on the team, or preview hosts block the deployment. |
| `allowedActors` | yes | GitHub usernames that may start the factory, by label or by the "Run workflow" button. |
| `boxLimit` | no | The Upstash plan's Box limit. With it, `check-setup.mjs` works out whether the workers fit next to whatever else is on the account. |
| `browser` | no | Browser access for every Box the factory creates: a Chromium that Upstash runs, reachable as `box.browser` and shown in the Upstash console. Default `true`. It is fixed when a Box is created, and a Box made from a worker image gets whatever the Box the image was built in had. So changing it later means deleting the workers and rebuilding the image. See `upstash-box.md`. |
| `runtime` | no | Upstash Box runtime. Default `node`. Check the Box docs for other values, and re-run the smoke test if you change it, because other runtimes may not ship the agent CLIs. |
| `waitForWorkerMinutes` | no | How long a run waits for a free worker. Default 30. The runner is billed while it waits. |
| `agentTimeoutMinutes` | no | Limit for one agent run. Default 25. |
| `commandTimeoutMinutes` | no | Limit for a repo's setup, and for its checks. Default 20. |
| `imageBuildTimeoutMinutes` | no | Limit for `worker/setup.sh` during an image build. Default 30. |
| `snapshotId` | no | Shared worker image, written by `build-snapshot.mjs --shared`. |
| `imageCleanPaths` | no | Extra paths under `/workspace/home` to delete before a snapshot, such as the transcript folder of a third agent CLI. Claude Code's and Codex's are removed already. |
| `secretScanPatterns` | no | Extra text patterns (grep -E) that mark a secret, added to the built-in list used before a snapshot. |

Keep the workflow's `timeout-minutes` (150 in the template) above the worst case: waiting, setup, two agent runs and two rounds of checks. `check-setup.mjs` does that sum and complains when it does not fit. A run that the workflow limit kills skips its cleanup and leaves the worker busy.

## labels

`ready`, `running`, `review`, `needsAttention`: the issue label names. All required. `install-trigger.mjs` creates them in each app repo.

## agents

One entry per agent type. The name is 1 to 14 lowercase letters, digits or dashes, because each Box gets the label `agent-<name>` and issues use `agent:<name>`.

| Key | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `command` | yes | Shell command that runs the agent without any prompt. `{prompt}` is a file with the task. `{summary}` is the file the final reply has to end up in. |
| `cli` | no | Name of the agent's executable, for the smoke test's "is it installed" check. Default: the first word of `command`. Set it when the command starts with something else, such as a variable assignment or `timeout`. |
| `priority` | no | A number. The agent type with the highest priority that has a free worker takes an unlabelled issue. Types without one count as 0. Among equals, the type with the smaller share of busy workers goes first. |
| `promptExtra` | no | Text added to the end of every task for this agent type. `{summary}` in it becomes the summary file's path. For a CLI that cannot deliver a clean final reply through the command line: "When you are done, write your summary to the file {summary}." |
| `auth` | no | Secrets placed in the Box before each job and removed after it. Each entry: `secret` (name of the GitHub secret and `.env` key), plus `env` (export as this variable) or `file` (write to this path in the Box). Optional `localFile`: where the value lives on the user's machine when it is not in `.env`. |
| `env` | no | Extra environment variables for the agent. Not secret. |
| `boxSettings` | yes | The model and effort stored in the Box. `"ask"` until the user has been asked, `[]` for the CLI's own defaults, or a list of settings files. See `agents.md`. |
| `jobFiles` | no | Files from the factory repo copied into the Box at the start of every job: `{ "from": "worker/CLAUDE.md", "to": "/workspace/home/.claude/CLAUDE.md" }`. For house rules the user edits often. Read fresh each job, so no image rebuild is needed. |
| `setup` | no | This agent type's own image setup script. Default `worker/setup.sh`. |
| `snapshotId` | no | This agent type's worker image, written by `build-snapshot.mjs`. Wins over `factory.snapshotId`. |
| `description` | no | A note for humans. |

## repos

| Key | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `repo` | yes | `owner/name`. Same owner as the factory repo, because one fine-grained token covers one owner. |
| `baseBranch` | yes | Branch that factory pull requests target, and that each job clones. It may differ from the repo's default branch. |
| `setup` | no | Commands that install dependencies, run after the clone. |
| `checks` | no | Commands that must pass before a pull request is opened. The agent gets one retry with the failure output. |
| `secrets` | no | Secrets the repo's own setup, tests and checks need: `{ "secret": "TEST_DATABASE_URL", "env": "DATABASE_URL" }`. The value comes from `.env` locally and from the factory repo's GitHub secrets in a run. They are written to their own file in the Box for the job and removed after it. The agent sees them too, since it runs the tests. |
| `exclude` | no | Patterns added to `.git/info/exclude` for the job, for things the setup creates inside the repo folder that the repo's `.gitignore` misses, such as `.venv/`. |

All `setup` commands run as one bash login script, and so do all `checks`. State carries from one line to the next, so `python3 -m venv .venv` followed by `source .venv/bin/activate` works, and tools that the worker image put on `PATH` through `/etc/profile.d` are found. The first failing command stops the script, and its name is reported on the issue. A failing setup is reported as a factory problem, not as the agent's fault.

## workers

A list of `{ "id": "claude-01", "agent": "claude", "enabled": true }`. The id is lowercase letters, digits and dashes. `enabled: false` parks a worker without deleting its Box. Count the Boxes against the Upstash plan's limit. Paused Boxes count.

An agent type with no enabled worker gets no `agent:` label and no secrets. An issue that asks for it is handed back at once with `factory:needs-attention`.
